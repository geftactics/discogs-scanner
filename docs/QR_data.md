title: QR Data
---

Your vinyl items should have a QR code with data formatted as: 'release_id.instance_id'.

Instance ID is difficult to get hold of, so we have provided a tool to download a CSV of your collection, with a field including the data to use in the QR code.

Once you have downloaded the CSV, it is possible to perform a mail-merge using Microsoft Word, to generate/print the labels with a QR code.
